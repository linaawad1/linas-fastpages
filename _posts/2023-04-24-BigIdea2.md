### Final Score: 25/25

#### Reflection: 
I did a lot better on this college board mc compared to all the past ones. I think all the content was fresh in my head and I had a grasp of what was going on. There were a lot of conceptual problems that I was used to with all the work we did in class. I also took this quiz more seriously and put more effort in compared to usual.


#### Problems I still struggled with:
I think if I was to choose the problems I struggled with I would say its the ones where I had to implement information and use it in a program instead of answering a question conceptually.
