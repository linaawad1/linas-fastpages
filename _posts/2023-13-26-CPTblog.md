# Individual CPT blog

### So far...
- So far I have created my own database in my backend flask
- We attempted to connect the front and backend but we had some issues that we need to work through
- I also designed the front end of my portion
- My group also designed a photo slide at the beginning of the website on the home page
- We also have our frontend for our sign up page done

### To do...
- We are currently working on connected the backend to the frontend currently and working to deploy it.
- I also want to add some more crud to my database because of the new stuff we recently learned about it in a lesson.
- Furthermore, I like the image lessons we talked about and I think it would be fun to use it to design my frontend
- Basically my biggest priority is running my database so at least my purpose is shown and the program works
