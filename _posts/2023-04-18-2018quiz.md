# Question Review

Final Score = 64/66

## Question 1

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quesone.png)

- My Answer: C

### Why did I choose this?
- I chose C probably because I misread the whole question and because looking now that was already included in the question

### Why was it wrong?
- This option is incorrect. The code segment never changes the value of second.

- Right Answer: B

### Why?
- The code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the initial values of first and second have been interchanged.

## Question 3

- My Answer: A

### Why did I choose this?
- I chose option A because I thought it would give a more diverse look to see many people in one place. But now I see how there wouldn't be a need to use a distributed approach.

### Why was it wrong?
- If the participants must all be in the same location, there would be no need to use a distributed approach.

- Right Answer: C

### Why?
- If data measurements need to be taken from many locations, it would be beneficial to have participants from around the world collect the data.


## Reflections
- Overall, I did a lot better than normal. When I struggled I looked up answers but this time I was more mindful to really look and understand the question. I also took my time and was more dilligent taking this quiz in comparison to normal.
