It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. . Clouds Impression | Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ...&lt;/p&gt; meta deta is data that gives context and a title to other forms of data. | File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab Different file types like png and jpg are meant for different purposes when holding an image. There are different patterns that the file types analyze and use for data compression. | . | Size, height and width, number of pixels The number of pixels in an image will determine the resolution of the image. The more pixels, the more details that create a higher resolution. The size and width also determine how many pixels are needed to make a clear picture. So obviously, a larger picture would need more pixels in order to have a good resolution. | . | Visual perception, lossy compression Similar to what I mentioned before, the visual perception will be much clearer if there is a higher resolution. However, lossy compression can cause data to be lost. If there is data lost the perception can be altered and the resolution can go down. | . | . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks.

This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. &lt;/p&gt; What are commands you use in terminal to access files? we use commands like cd, ls, etc. | . | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? Windows also use cd, dir, etc. | . | What are some of the major differences? One of the major differences we talked about during the lecture was the use of the forward slash in macbook terminals and the use of a backward slash for separating windows directories. | . | . &lt;/blockquote&gt; Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code.&lt;/p&gt; Why is path a big deal when working with images? Path is a big deal when working with images because the image must be in the right directory or file in order to be properly integrated based on the type of image it is. Also, there must be a way to see where the image is coming from and how to access it. | . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? I am not exactly sure but I am thinking it might have something to do with crowd sourcing. It kind of guides what data is being collected and outlines the whole dataset and outside information | . | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images?

Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? 64 characters per symbol. In Hexadecimal there are 10 characters and in binary there are 2 characters per position. Use it to tranfer things into our apis if we have images?&lt;/p&gt; - Base64 is especially similar to binary and hexadecimal because they all represent how many characters are used in the name. It is also different than the others because it obviously uses 64 characters and binary uses 2 characters and hexadecimal has 10 characters. We can use it to transfer things into our apis by utilizing the characters to create a text format. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64.

Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags.&lt;/p&gt; Where have you been a consumer of buffering? I have been a consumer of buffering on streaming services when a file is loading or about to be played. While I wait it buffers and I am the consumer. | . | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? From buffering more issues can be caused. For example, I am thinking that if many people on the wifi have things buffering, it will only make things worse and create deeper issues. | . | How do these effects apply to images? The images may not ever render or load and it will cause issues in the system that are more deeply rooted than just the image being shown. | . | . &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program.&lt;/p&gt; Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? This code seems like a series of steps being preformed because there must be steps in order to change how the image is rendered. | . | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? From what I understand, in order to grey scale images, we must average all the colors given, like red, green, and blue. You average these pixels in order to create the grey and focusing on one will tint the color towards one of the colors | . | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? Scale image means changing the perception of the image and it also comes with altering the pixels of the image and can be connected with the change in color. In the images, the pixels change by color but it remains by pixel. | . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scale image is a type of compression because it changes the original image to what the scale wants and alters the different pixels. | . | . &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smiley Face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smiley.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;
